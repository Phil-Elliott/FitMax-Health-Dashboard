A React application used to track the cardio activities of the user. These activities can be compared with the goals that the user sets. The user's data is stored in a database created with PostgreSQL and connected to a server that was made with Node and Express.

## How it works

The user first registers or logs in with their email and password. The dashboard will then load with the users data. The dashboard has three four options on the navigation bar. These include running, biking, swimming, and a sign out button. The user can select the cardio activity and this will display any activity that they have entered in the past.

The top left box is used to display the users cardio data and there is a button in the top right that is used to add new activities. The user can select between daily, weekly, monthly, and total. These buttons will display the data for these different periods of time.

The bottom left box is used to display the users goals and compare that to their activity. The user can choose between distance, calories, and speed. The user can enter new goals by clicking the top right button in the box.

The top right box is used to display all of the data on a graph. The bottom right box is used to display the history of all of the runs. The user can delete data by clicking on the delete icon next to each run.

## Software Used

The app was built with React and React Hooks. All fetch requests are done with Axios. The styling was done with SCSS. The server was created with Node and Express. It uses Knex.js to connect the server to the database that was made with PostgreSql.

## What I learned

This project has provided me with a lot of experience with the software that I decided to use. I learned a lot about the benefits of creating a single page application with React. I really enjoyed being able to use State to move data throughout the application. My Javascript also improved a lot from this project. I had to work a lot with creating arrays and displaying that data throughout the app in diffirent ways.

I struggled a lot with the backend of this project, but that is also where I learned the most. I learned how to create a server and make diffirent requests from my database. I also learned how to make a database and use PostgreSql. This was a lot diffirent that everything else that I have learned about working with the Front End. It was really great to get a complete understanding of how an application works.

The best part about this project was that I gained a great understanding of what it takes to be a developer. My problem solving skills improved a lot and I have gotten a lot better at finding solutions through google or the documentation. This has given me a lot of confidence in being able to take on more difficult projects, with software that I do not yet know how to use.
